# qr-enabled-postal-service-application
QR Postal Service is a basic Android Application which focuses on fixing a basic potential physical sensitive information malpractice. 
This app is integrated with Firebase for Authentication stuff and we make use of his details. User who makes an account will get access to
enter details of any of his Post receivers so that this app creates a new unique QR code so that the user can utilize that code image rather 
than manully writing or transcribing on the cover. 
This imposes a new restriction that the exectives has to use to decode this to deliver to the destination. But creates a better kind of 
approach and can form a basic security measures in existing courier services.

PS: suggested to clone this repo using Android Studio for Version Maintainance and Hazzle-free experience.
